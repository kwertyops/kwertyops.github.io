Ooooh, did I hear that right? Is LAPOMPE playing a show at the The Oriental Theater? Go ahead, tell them about it, Dave!

Dave: "Well, lemme tell ya.... https://www.facebook.com/events/396331334767299"

That's right, Dave. It's been a long time since we've played out and we're starting to miss you all, so if you're missing us too come hang out for a set or two!

Dave: "Reminder this event will sell-out. Since its super limited seating. First Set: Django Classics, Second Set: Originals.  Or get a discount for coming to both!"

Thanks, Dave. Hope to see you all there!

Dave: "Hope to see you there!"

I just said that...
