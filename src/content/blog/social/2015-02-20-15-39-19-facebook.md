one more pretty one before we get into the hard stuff. this is a piano/guitar duet, featuring Tim Sauer on the piano. maybe a bit unfinished but I think it stands on it's own. has a bit o' that Renaissance feel to it. I give you... with thanks to all of the DnD participators because Tim doesn't have facebook.. Andrew Wilson Margie Hannum Scott Erickson Matthew James Simonson
