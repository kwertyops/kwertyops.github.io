I bought an Ibanez AF75 that had a bridge buzz/rattle in-store. They tightened the intonation screws and it fixed it, and I loved the guitar so I bought it.

Then I got home and after another hour or two the buzz/rattle came back. I tightened the screws, it went away... Then it came back again.

Eventually, after reading online that this was a common problem, I bought the following drop-in replacement bridge:

I got it in gold because my original hardware was gold. 

Got it, replaced it, have had zero problems since. Also seems like the overall sound is just slightly better from some reason I can't put my finger on.
