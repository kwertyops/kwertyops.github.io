I'm saying that for a D Dominant (D7) chord, you can play an arpeggios consisting of the notes:

* Eb (the b9 of D)
* F# (the 3rd of D)
* A (the 5th of D)
* C (the b7 of D)

Altogether those are the Eb diminished 7 chord. (also worth mentioning that those same 4 notes could be called Ebo7, F#o7, Ao7, or Co7)

In other words, the Eb diminished 7 chord contains all the notes from D7, except the D which has been raised a half step to Eb (the b9 of D).
