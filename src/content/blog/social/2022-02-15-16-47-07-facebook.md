I know it's a day late, but I just don't post here that often and I want to have at least one post that tells you how god damn much I love this woman. 
If you've seen me any time in the past like 3 years you know, but some of you haven't and I just want you to know. 
She is what they mean when they talk about angels. If you've met her, you know, because you love her too. And if you haven't met her, then when you do you'll love her, if you love me. 
She is just everything good in the world, and I am so damn lucky to have her in my life.
I love you Natalie Anderson ðŸ˜˜
