This seems to be more simply all the data about the physical orientations and positions of neurons in a fly&#x27;s nervous system.<p>I&#x27;d guess there is still humongous amounts of data missing that would be necessary for a simulation:<p>- the exact biological and chemical makeup of each neuron<p>- the biological and chemical environment in which those neurons exist<p>- the exact physics that govern the biological and chemical reactions happening in and around the neurons (and the ability to accurately simulate those physics)<p>- maybe most importantly, even if we have all those above (i.e. the ability to fully and accurately simulate biological systems as complex as individual cells), we may still missing the electro-chemical activation &quot;state&quot; of the neurons that allows the fly to operate as a cohesive whole. (as if we had all of the hardware of a computer, but none of the software)
