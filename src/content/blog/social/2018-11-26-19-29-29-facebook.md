I do Today Present to You, most esteemed Audience, A SELECTION OF TWO EXPERIMENTS IN ELECTRONIC MUSIC:

https://soundcloud.com/andyhannum/sets/a-selection-of-two-experiments

(thank you to Matthew for some of the foundational samples)

---

The FIRST: 'Mallory and Mothy Jones (the Ballad of)'

a wedding gift to our mutual friends, so named above. 

it rises from the Earth. an electricity. 

but with thought(fulness), it gives way to a sudden moment of inspiration!

a passion and excitement then is followed by a long, enduring peace.............

you float among clouds.

after a time, as even the peace itself begins to fade, you are left with a story and a heartbeat. whose? you're not quite sure.

---

The SECOND: 'Reflexonomy'

you begin somewhere familiar.

as you move forwards, gradually the scenery starts to change, until even the change itself becomes unfamiliar. 

and then, before you know it, you're in an entirely different world. a world of magic and color. 

just as you begin to feel that you know this new place, that you begin to see where you are going... then, just as quickly, you return.

what did you learn from the new world while you were there?

and what do you even remember about this old world, now that you're back?
