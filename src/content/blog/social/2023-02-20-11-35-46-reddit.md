Ah gotcha. I saw it plugged in and thought, damn that's a great sounding pickup! But yes, the big tones by themselves are pretty nasty.

In case you've never heard of it you might take a look at the Tonedexter (https://audiosprockets.com/) - it's my main method of live amplification for gypsy jazz guitar, and it does a phenomenal job of making a piezo pickup like the big tone sound like a microphone. It's not cheap, but there are similar and cheaper options I haven't explored (LR Baggs Voiceprint, or NU-X Optima Air).

Edit: Correction, the LR Baggs is definitely not cheaper than a Tonedexter. The NU-X is, though.
