A little while ago I filled out a super trippy application/questionnaire for a private psychedelic festival being held at a chateau in France.

Somehow it turns out I answered with the right combination of crazy and awesome, so I got accepted.

It sounds really cool and mysterious but I'm not going, for a number of reasons - even if I wanted to, my passport is expired and I haven't received the renewal yet.

Just posting this for myself, for the memory.
