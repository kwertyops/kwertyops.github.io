So I got access to DALL-E 2, and of course the first thing I did was generate a bunch of fake artwork for friend's bands. Can you tell which bands these album covers / tshirt designs are for? (Hint: it can't really do text, but sometimes the starting letters of the text are suggestive... not always)

If you get any right, I'll post the prompts that led to them and some extra bonus artwork for some.
