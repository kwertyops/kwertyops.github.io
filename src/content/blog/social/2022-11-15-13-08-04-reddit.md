Take any one-octave closed voicing of a 4-note chord, in any inversion. For example a maj7 chord could be:

1 3 5 7 , or
3 5 7 1 , or
5 7 1 3 , or
7 1 3 5

Now take the second highest note in one of those inversions and drop it an octave:

**5** 1 3 7 , or
**7** 3 5 1 , or
**1** 5 7 3 , or
**3** 7 1 5

That is a drop2 voicing. There is a drop2 voicing for any inversion you want, including one where the root is in the bottom (maybe you’d call this root position?).

Same thing for drop3 and drop 2/4.
