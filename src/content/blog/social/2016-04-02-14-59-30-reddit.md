Keep in mind that if you're making music from scratch, as opposed to producing/mixing someone else's music, then you not only have to learn how to produce, but you also need to learn how to.. well.. be a musician.

If you're trying to produce and write your own music, and you don't already have a musical background (play an instrument, or something) then take the amount of time you expect you'd need to learn the technical "trade" aspects of production (like plumbing/programming, as Batwaffel said) and then double it for the time needed to also become a competent musician.

Ask yourself - is the stuff you're making "crap" because the sound quality is bad (lack of production skills) or because it's musically uninteresting (lack of musicianship)? If it's the latter and you want to continue trying to make your own music from scratch, you should maybe consider focusing more time on learning an instrument if you haven't already.
