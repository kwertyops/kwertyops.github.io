It&#x27;s weird that I almost immediately had the thought for essentially exactly the same approach while reading the article. Not that this reflects on OP; flashes of solutions like that I think are often mostly random.<p>But I wonder if this is a sign of things to come - rather than needing to find explicit deterministic solutions to many problems that might actually have one, because ML is getting much more powerful and accessible instead we&#x27;ll just use ML models and get 99.9% accurate solutions, but say, well that&#x27;s good enough.
