okay so (video below) - building a neural network to come up with sheet music exercises, but the music it comes up with when it "dreams" (ie: feed its output back into its input) is kind of pretty, if maybe badly composed.

it names the songs too :) "Paganini MS84 37sonates No. 92".

the image (view in HD) is also made by a "deep dreaming" or "hallucinating" neural net, originally trained for image recognition. can you spot the girl with the green aura? or the man wearing the interdimensional wizard's hat?

I like mr. bird-face up in the top right. and I'm definitely also seeing a floating buddha guy chilling with the aura girl.

Rusty Bower this is whats up ;D
