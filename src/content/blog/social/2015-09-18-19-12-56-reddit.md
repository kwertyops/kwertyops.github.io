I think this response was a little extreme. You definitely want to learn CAGED-style theory as well, but these both have their place. 

CAGED will give you more "absolute" tonal knowledge, helping you with things like always knowing where you are, and how different arpeggios lay on top of each other. 

But horizontal arpeggios will give you more "relative" tonal knowledge. Because they are repeated, often symmetrical, fixed patterns, they give a stronger foundation for easily remembering how things sound relative to their shape - for example in the context of licks.

I agree that learning CAGED is probably better for you at this stage, but I don't think you need to get a new teacher. I'm sure there are things you can learn from this person as well. If you like their playing and they are able to convey information to you well, I think that's all that matters.
