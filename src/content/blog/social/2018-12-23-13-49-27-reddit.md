That would be a seriously altered A7. It would be an A7b9#11. I can't think of a context in which you would use those particular alterations.

To me that's more of an Eb/A (that is, Ebmaj over a b5). That's still weird by itself but try a progression like this:

Eb/Bb  ->  Eb/A  ->  Ab7  ->  Eb

Notice the bass walkdown from the 5, to the b5, to the 4, then resolving to the I. To me that feels essentially like a simple reharmonization of:

Eb  ->  Eb7  ->  Ab7  -> Eb

or in other words:

I  ->  I7  ->  IV7  -> I

just in this case your I7 would have the alteration of a b5:

I  -> I7b5  -> IV7  -> I
