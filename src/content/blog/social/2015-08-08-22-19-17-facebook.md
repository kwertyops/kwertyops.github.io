We have a bunch of upcoming events this next week that we cordially invite you to attend.

August 9th Sunday 11am-2pm. "Meet in the Street" 
16th Street Mall (between Arapahoe and Lawrence)

August 13th Thursday 9:30-Midnight 
Vine Street Pub & Brewery

August 14th Friday 8:30-11:30 
The Crown Social http://www.crownsocialdenver.com/

This last event is particularly awesome. It's a new venue for us with a great outdoor patio. Plenty of room to dance, and they have fantastic Colorado spirits, beers, & wines! Please join us for one or all of them!!

Big thank you to the Denver Art Museum for having us play for their fantastic "Untitled: Final Fridays" event! This is our take on "Undecided". Thank you Yuko!
