I'm a little late on the share with this, but if you haven't watched Meadow Mountain's new video, it is a PHENOMENAL piece of work by Erik Fellenstein to go with an awesome song (that I often find stuck in my head these days).

I feel lucky and honored to have gotten to be a part of it, however small. Thanks to Erik and the band for letting me try something new that I've been wanting to try for a long time.

And go to their headlining debut tomorrow night at The Bluebird Theater!

Also if you have any simple short animation ideas that you want to throw my way I had a lot of fun doing this stuff and I'd like to keep exploring the medium!
