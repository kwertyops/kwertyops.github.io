What I've heard (and am about to find out) is that Master's programs in CS don't do much more than undergraduate degrees. Maybe if you're lucky you do a little more research, you write a thesis, and then you're in the exact same position you were a year or two ago.<p>What I'm thinking is.. Just start doing stuff on your own. Figure out things you want to make and try to make them. Join some open-source projects, start some open-source projects, build a portfolio of things that you made and code you've written that potential employers can actually look at. At this point I'm just regurgitating advice that I've heard too many times, but that doesn't mean it's not good advice.
