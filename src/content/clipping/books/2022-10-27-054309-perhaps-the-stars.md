> I could almost hear it in my mind in Their dead voice: “If deaths must be, let them be _____.” What adjective would it have been? What language? Something more honest than ‘good,’ less pretentious than ‘just,’ the opposite of ‘pointless’ but not pretending death could ever be ‘alright.’ ‘Examined,’ maybe? ‘Willed’? A tingle washed through me. So few prayers are in the Prince’s power to grant, but here was one I pray myself: if I’m shot, let me be shot for what I fight for, not for some mistake.
