> Mowlana's beautiful poem of reincarnation: I died as mineral and became a plant, I died as plant and rose as animal, I died as animal and I was Man. Why should I fear? When was I less by dying? Yet once more I shall die as Man, to soar With angels blessed; but even from angelhood I must pass on: “All save the face of God doth perish.” When I have sacrificed my angelic soul, I shall become what no mind has ever conceived, Oh, let me not exist! for non-existence Proclaims in organ tones: “To Him shall we return.”
