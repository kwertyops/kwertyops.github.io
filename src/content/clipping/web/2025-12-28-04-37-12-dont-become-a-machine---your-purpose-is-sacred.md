> Hustle-culture optimizes for work input because it's sexy. It's easy to post the inputs. It's hard to face the output.

> The truth is you don't have to become the machine in order to succeed. The machine can't adapt. It can't learn the rules of the game. It is deterministic, set in place, chugging along at a linear pace.

> Instead, aim to be nimble. Adapt quick. Define your goal but don't let it become your purpose. Your purpose is sacred; only you truly understand it. Do what you need to do in order to achieve your goals. Don't optimize for sweat. Try to find the most rewarding solution. Optimize for what matters: speed, efficiency, or quality—whatever it may be.
