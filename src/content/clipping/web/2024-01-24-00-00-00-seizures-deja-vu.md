> My simple partial seizures are always strong deja vu, never mystical, though it is very strange thinking that you kinda knew what someone was going to say while they are saying it. Almost like I could say it along with them. It's the same if I'm reading something, the words seem to 'fit' the context I'm in or the thoughts I had moments before reading the words.
