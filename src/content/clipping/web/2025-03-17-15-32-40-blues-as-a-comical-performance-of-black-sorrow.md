> Anyway Charlie freed the guitar from all that baggage. He didn't "twang," and he didn't do a lot of showy emotive bending and he had little or no vibrato. That's a lot like lester young, but it's also I think a move to escape the minstrel shows and the blues as comical a performance of black sorrow for white people. I mean you can kind of see the legacy of the minstrel show every time some guy with 9s on the top is doing boomer bends and making guitar face playing blues.
