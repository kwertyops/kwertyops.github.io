> Poem 013: Did I Miss Anything?
> 
> Nothing. When we realized you weren’t here
> we sat with our hands folded on our desks
> in silence, for the full two hours
> 
>    Everything. I gave an exam worth
>    40 percent of the grade for this term
>    and assigned some reading due today
>    on which I’m about to hand out a quiz
>    worth 50 percent
> 
> Nothing. None of the content of this course
> has value or meaning
> Take as many days off as you like:
> any activities we undertake as a class
> I assure you will not matter either to you or me
> and are without purpose
> 
>    Everything. A few minutes after we began last time
>    a shaft of light suddenly descended and an angel
>    or other heavenly being appeared
>    and revealed to us what each woman or man must do
>    to attain divine wisdom in this life and
>    the hereafter
>    This is the last time the class will meet
>    before we disperse to bring the good news to all people on earth.
> 
> Nothing. When you are not present
> how could something significant occur?
> 
>    Everything. Contained in this classroom
>    is a microcosm of human experience
>    assembled for you to query and examine and ponder
>    This is not the only place such an opportunity has been gathered
> 
>    but it was one place
> 
>    And you weren’t here
>
