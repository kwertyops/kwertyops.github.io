> For the millionth time: You don't get to jerk off to filmed rape under socialism.
> 
> Every socialist state that ever existed has banned porn.
> 
> Yes, porn is coercive as every form of wage labor is. But it is not just any wage labor, but labor involved in the social production of art - in this case reactionary art.
> 
> Why is it reactionary? Its ideological content is. It objectifies - or more precisely, commodifies (primarily female) bodies. It dehumanizes women. It is the reason why you have white people going around fetishizing Asian women.
> 
> Porn fits into the capitalist superstructure which reproduces the institutions of patriarchy, and by extension, of capitalism itself. It has no place in a socialist society. The suppression of pornography then isn't simply the suppression of commodity production, it would be similar to the suppression of any other reactionary cultural product (music, films, etc...).
