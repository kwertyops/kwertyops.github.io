> Level 1
> 
> Achieve feeling good as the default baseline mood.
> Whenever feeling bad, first get back to feeling good.
> * To do this, notice your ongoing habit of feeding the feeling (including attempts to 'change' it), and cease doing that. Cease everything but (simply) be aware of the feeling.
> * When you do this, the body’s native intelligence will automatically see the feeling to be silly, and you are back to feeling good.

> \[Richard\]: ‘The ego – or even the soul as pure spirit – is not to be confused with will. The bodily needs are what motivates will – and will is nothing more grand than the nerve-organising data-correlating ability of the body – and it is will that is essential in order to operate and function … not an identity. Will is an organising process, an activity of the brain that correlates all the information and data that streams through the bodily senses. Will is not a ‘thing’, a subjectively substantial passionate ‘object’, like the identity is. Will, freed of the encumbrance of the ego and soul – which are born out of instinctual fear and aggression and nurture and desire – can operate smoothly, with actual sagacity. The operation of this freed will, is called intelligence. This intelligence is the body’s native intelligence … and has naught to do with any disembodied ‘Intelligence behind the Universe’ It is a joy to be me going about my business with freed-will in this wonderful physical world’.
