> I’ve been reading Kim Stanley Robinson’s Mars Trilogy recently, a near-future sci-fi epic of terraforming, ecology, politics, big history.
> 
> One of the intriguing background details in this story is that everyone has a personal AI.
> 
> > Your AI can think with you, riffing on possibilities, helping spark creative breakthroughs.
> 
> > Your AI keeps a running a log, and fine-tunes itself on everything you’ve been thinking about.
> 
> > You can talk to your AI, like Siri. You can also read it, like a book, and add notes to it, like a notebook.
> 
> > Your AI can do research for you, ambiently crawling the net for things you’re thinking about, reporting back.
> 
> > Your AI can talk with other AIs, negotiating with them to get information you need.
> 
> > Your AI can do complex calculations and spot high-dimensional patterns… the kind of thinking computers are good at.
> 
> > The data in your AI belongs to you. It is end-to-end encrypted. Only you can access its locked contents. Yours for life. You might even pass down a personal AI to your kids, like sharing an old journal, but interactive.
> 
> An AI networked notebook. A second brain.
