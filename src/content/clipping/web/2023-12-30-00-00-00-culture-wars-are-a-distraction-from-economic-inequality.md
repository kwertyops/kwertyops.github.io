> Capitalist entities use culture wars as a distraction from the class struggle because it diverts attention away from economic disparities. By emphasizing social and cultural differences, the focus shifts from addressing systemic inequalities and exploitation inherent in capitalism. This diversion can maintain the status quo and prevent solidarity among different socio-economic classes, hindering collective efforts to challenge the power structures that perpetuate economic inequality.
