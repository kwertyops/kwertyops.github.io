> Pangrams which use all the phonemes, or phones, of English (rather than alphabetic characters):
>
> > "With tenure, Suzie'd have all the more leisure for yachting, but her publications are no good." (for certain US accents and phonological analyses)
> 
> > "Shaw, those twelve beige hooks are joined if I patch a young, gooey mouth." (perfect for certain accents with the cot-caught merger)
> 
> > "Are those shy Eurasian footwear, cowboy chaps, or jolly earthmoving headgear?" (perfect for certain Received Pronunciation accents)
> 
> > "The beige hue on the waters of the loch impressed all, including the French queen, before she heard that symphony again, just as young Arthur wanted." (a phonetic, not merely phonemic, pangram. It contains both nasals [m] and [É±] (as in 'symphony'), the fricatives [x] (as in 'loch') and [Ã§] (as in 'hue'), and the 'dark L' [É«] (as in 'all') – in other words, it contains different allophones.)
