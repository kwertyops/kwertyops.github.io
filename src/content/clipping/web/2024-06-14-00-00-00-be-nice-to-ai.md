> I have thought about this a lot lately. The relationship we have to AI assistants is fundamentally sociopathic -- we instrumentalize them. They are a means to an end.

> This is fine. They are tools & have no thoughts, feelings, moral worth. So we treat them appropriately. BUT...

> We relate to them through the medium of language, by stating our intentions as we would to a fellow sentient being. There has never been another tool -- another instrument of zero inherent moral worth -- that we have related to through the medium of language.

> So I'm generally polite to the chatbots not because I care about the chatbots but because I care about myself. I don't want to regularly relate to anything via my words in a way that purely instrumentalizes it, in a way that's sociopathic. I don't want to get used to that feeling. It creeps me out & I suspect it's bad for me.

> I'm not advocating that everyone else be polite to chatbots, but I might at some point advocate that on the grounds that to do otherwise is to practice using language in a way that's evil. I dunno. We'll see.
