Tim Minchin giving a commencement speech:

> "Remember, It’s All Luck You are lucky to be here. You were incalculably lucky to be born, and incredibly lucky to be brought up by a nice family that helped you get educated and encouraged you to go to Uni. Or if you were born into a horrible family, that’s unlucky and you have my sympathy. . . but you were still lucky: lucky that you happened to be made of the sort of DNA that made the sort of brain which - when placed in a horrible childhood environment - would make decisions that meant you ended up, eventually, graduating Uni. Well done you, for dragging yourself up by the shoelaces, but you were lucky. You didn’t create the bit of you that dragged you up. They’re not even your shoelaces."
> 
> “Understanding that you can’t truly take credit for your successes, nor truly blame others for their failures will humble you and make you more compassionate. Empathy is intuitive, but is also something you can work on, intellectually.”

Conan O'Brien interviewing Bo Burnham:

> “What’s your advice for young people?"

> Bo Burnham: “You just gotta take a deep breath and. . . give up. . . The system is rigged against you. Your hard work and talent will not pay off. I would say don’t take advice from people like me who have gotten very lucky. Like, Taylor Swift telling you to follow your dreams is like a lottery winner saying, ‘Liquidize your assets, buy Powerball tickets, it works!’?'’

> Conan O'Brien: “I say, I work really hard, I think I have some ability, but I also got really lucky. . . And when some people act like that’s not part of it, it makes me a little crazy.’’

> Bo Burnham: “Yeah, of course. And we’re tall white guys! We overcame nothing to be here. There was nothing standing in our way and we barely got here. . . You have no chance."
