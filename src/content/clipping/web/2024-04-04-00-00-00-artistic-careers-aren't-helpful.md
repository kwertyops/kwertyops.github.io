> Q: How do you think about art and music? Are you saying people who want to make the world better shouldn't go into artistic careers?

> Art and music clearly bring a lot of joy to a lot of people, and a world without them would be much worse. On the other hand, I think this is somewhere it's helpful to look on the margin: what is the benefit of an additional person going into art or music? What is the benefit of that person going into reducing global poverty, harm to animals, or global catastrophic risk? So many people are eager to get into art and music that we're far from a world in which we suffer from too few options here.
