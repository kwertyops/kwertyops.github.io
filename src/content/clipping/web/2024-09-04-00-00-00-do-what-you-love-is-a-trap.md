> The desire for the cool job that you're passionate about is a particularly modern and bourgeois phenomenon - and, as we'll see, a means of elevating a certain type of labor to the point of desirability that workers will tolerate all forms of exploitation for the "honor" of performing it. The rhetoric of "Do you what you love, and you'll never work another day in your life" is a burnout trap. By cloaking the labor in the language of "passion," we're prevented from thinking of what we do as what it is: a job, not the entirety of our lives.
