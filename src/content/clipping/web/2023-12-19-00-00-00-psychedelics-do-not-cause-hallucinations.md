> Psychedelics do not cause hallucinations, but increased sensory sensitivity

> For understanding the psychedelic experience, it’s important to understand that there is fellacy \[sic\] around thinking that our sober mind somehow sees the actual real world. It’s an abstraction made from data. Sober world is abstraction, LSD world is abstraction, DMT world is abstraction. The only thing that differentiates those states is how related they are to sensory inputs from the environment.

> Psychedelics, however, give us some quality for the price of the functionality. After ingesting psychedelic, there is now more data that is processed and included in creating a subjective reality, as if our picture of the world went from lower to higher quality, ‘1080p to 4K.’ Subjective perception wasn’t guided by evolutionary pressure to give us the most accurate, highest resolution reality perception, but the highest possible ‘resolution’ that maintains constant fluidity of the experience without the stutter.
