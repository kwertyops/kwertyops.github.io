> Look at your favorite artists, alive or dead, the ones who you have always aspired to be as a professional. Chances are they have had one of three types of musical careers. Every professional musician I’ve met has fallen into one of these macro categories. I know it seems like an overgeneralization, but it continues to prove itself to be tried and true in my experience, so just hear me out.

1.	Independently Wealthy Artists:
These artists come from affluent backgrounds, allowing them to focus on their craft without worrying about financial pressures. They have time to practice, create, and perform because their financial stability is often supported by family wealth. This privilege gives them a significant advantage, but Max acknowledges that while they may produce excellent work, their experience isn’t representative of the average artist.

2.	Lifers:
Lifers are artists who dedicate their entire lives to making a living from their art, often struggling financially and working tirelessly. They perform, tour, and release music constantly to survive, but this lifestyle is particularly difficult in the modern world of streaming platforms, which pay little. Lifers face ongoing challenges, especially in big cities where living costs are high, but they are driven by their passion for their art.

3.	Dayjobbers: 
These artists balance their artistic pursuits with a steady job outside of the arts, providing financial stability. Max encourages Billy, who is considering this path, not to view it as a failure. Instead, he sees it as a practical approach that allows artists to sustain their creative practices while ensuring peace of mind. Many famous artists, like Philip Glass and John Cage, had day jobs to support themselves while they created.
