> [Depressed individuals tend to avoid experiencing positive emotions](https://www.psypost.org/2024/01/depressed-individuals-tend-to-avoid-experiencing-positive-emotions-study-finds-221055). Nobody would ever consciously choose to avoid feeling good, so they must be doing it subconciously, and it must be hard not to. So I'm thinking, what instruction would you give to depressed people, to change their habits? Something like, "Imagine the world is full of very subtle invitations to feel good, like tiny packages that you can look for, and open."
