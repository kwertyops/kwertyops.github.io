chordmelody.io is a system designed to support guitarists in mastering the art of chord melody playing. This style, where melody and harmony are simultaneously performed on a single guitar, poses unique challenges due to the instrument’s physical and tuning constraints. The app addresses these challenges by systematically generating chord melody études for jazz and other tunes, using a focused set of genre-specific voicings—such as drop voicings—and aligning them with melody notes in ways that are playable with a single hand. By balancing playability, musicality, and pedagogical clarity, it aims to bridge the gap between brute-force memorization and the overwhelming complexity of professional arrangements. It encourages learners to build a foundational vocabulary of chord melody concepts while playing real music, equipping them to create their own arrangements.
