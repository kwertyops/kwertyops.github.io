By speaking to the theme of this years Open Access Week (24th - 30th Oct.), 'Open in Action', this event highlights the different ways by which making your research data openly accessible can lead to a variety of outcomes. Drawing on topics including jazz studies, music computing, practice based research and the ethics of open source, this panel will explore how we define and (re)use research data. Why should we make our research data Open Access? What route should we take to making it Open Access? And what can we do with openly accessible research and data.  In this session Benjamin Givan and Andrew Hannum will present an interesting example of sharing and using open data sets, bridging jazz studies and music computing. James Bulley will follow this to discuss one of his practice based research outputs, considering the distinction between data, information and documentation, while addressing issues of utility and re-usability.
