I've been waiting for something like this for so long, thank you and congratulations!

It looks like the editor itself is not open-source, is that correct? I would really love to be able to submit a pull request to add a light-themed option. 

This may sound crazy but the only thing stopping me from trying to use this right now in my intro to programming course is the visual look of it (mostly the color scheme). ðŸ˜†
