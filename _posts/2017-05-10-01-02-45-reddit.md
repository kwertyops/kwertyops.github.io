There's no need to curse, and no one said anything about popularity. This is not a self-promotion, nor is it a request for feedback. He is not an established artist, and it is the exact opposite of low effort content. That covers all the rules I see posted anywhere for this subreddit.

It is not against the letter of the rules. If your opinion is that it's against the spirit of the rules, then as an equally valid member of this community my opinion is that it isn't. But that's not up to you or me, it's up to the mods, so use the report button.

If your problem is that you think something about this is fake, I don't know what to tell you. I guess you can include that in your report to the mods.
