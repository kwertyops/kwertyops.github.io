hey thank you :) I listened to some of your stuff and I dig it too! maybe not surprising since like you said we have a bit of similar sound. 'Fear' is nice and chill, I could imagine listening to that on a long drive at night.

and thanks for the follow on soundcloud :p I'm trying to move away from it as a platform but there's still always gonna be stuff that shows up there and not on Spotify, etc.
