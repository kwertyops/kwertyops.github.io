thank you!! I'm always worried out production value so it's nice to hear that it's up to par. I make everything in Ableton, and as far as sounds it's pretty much a grab bag of anything I have available to me. I use a lot of instruments from Kontakt and I have a friend who is deep into the sample game and shares some stuff that he finds with me.
