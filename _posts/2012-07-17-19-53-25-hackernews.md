You really need to do this. Here was my thought process...<p>I'm vaguely interested in this, so I'm going to go to the site to check it out. --&#62; Hmm, okay 50 dollars, what was I here for again? --&#62; Oh, iPhone app template, cool. Let's see, $50 is a lot, I wonder what I get. --&#62; That picture can't possible be what I get, so I want to know what I get. --&#62; This is too hard to figure out, I'm gonna look for an open-source version. --&#62; ...<p>Not that I'm gonna be your typical customer, but maybe I could have been. YMMV.<p>[Edit] To be fair, I spent a little more time on your site and I like what I see, but that reaction should happen on the front page.
