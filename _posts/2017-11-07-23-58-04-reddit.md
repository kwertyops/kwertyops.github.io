First finger (index) on the E of the D string. Second finger (middle) on the C of the A string and simultaneously also the G on the E string. 

You're jumping back and forth between bowing the bottom two and top two strings together, while using your remaining two fingers to move the top G note up to C (pinky), back down to A (ring), back to G (middle), back to C (pinky), to A .. etc
