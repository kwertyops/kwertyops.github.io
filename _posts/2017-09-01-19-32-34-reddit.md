It is definitely not obvious what needs to be changed to do the "guitar tuning" the way I have done. I'm flabbergasted that it works at all. Honestly I broke the code more than anything else, I just broke it in a very particular way that produced the effect I wanted.

HOWEVER!!!

With that being said, the relevant changes are in a script in the 'pushbase' folder, which I believe is shared between the Push 1 and Push 2. So if you'd like, I can send you my modified file, and you can try with your Push 1. All you have to do is drop it in the folder, and Ableton automatically compiles it for you.

Shoot me a PM if you're interested in trying.
