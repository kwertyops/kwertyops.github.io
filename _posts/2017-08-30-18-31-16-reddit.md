Ah I misunderstood. To answer your question, the scale being shown in light pads is C major, but I'm using it mostly as guideposts, similar to the dots on a guitar fretboard. Or more accurately, the black and white keys on a piano. I orient myself relative to it, but it is not informing what I play at all. I am essentially disregarding the "key" entirely.
