Out of curiosity - are you willing to share broad strokes about your approach to the pitch detection algorithm?

In my own research, vocal pitch detection is so challenging (compared to other instruments) because (I think) of the variety of formants that are possible for any given note, and therefore the number of different kinds of harmonic spectrums you could see for the same fundamental.
