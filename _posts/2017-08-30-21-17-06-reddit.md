Yes definitely! Although as mentioned to others, a lot of that is from my guitar knowledge. The degree to which I can improvise on guitar is essentially the degree to which I can on the Push, with some extra limitations due to the number of pads. But with the note layout the way I like it, it feels a lot like I cheated my way into being able to play keyboard, without having to actually learn to play keyboard. :p
