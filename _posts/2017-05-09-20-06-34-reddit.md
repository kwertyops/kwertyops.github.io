To be honest I had a similar thought and hesitated to post, but he's made plenty of things that I don't care about enough to promote (no offense crumario), and I legitimately enjoy this thing in particular and want to make sure he keeps making it.

I can see it's towing a line, but my vested interest is that I enjoy the content, not that he's my friend. Maybe just better if I had not mentioned my relationship to him.
