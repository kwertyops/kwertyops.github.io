If you just want to noodle around in a scale and have it fit with different styles, this should get you pretty far:

------

Minor Pentatonic: Rock, Blues

Major Pentatonic: Country, Bluegrass, happier-sounding Blues

Major (Ionian) Scale: General happy music, simple jazz, nursery rhyme style stuff, happy sounding classical music style stuff

Dorian Scale: Darker sounding modern music, jazz/rock fusion, post-rock, modern rock, simpler metal

Minor (Aeolian) Scale: Darker sounding classical music style stuff, classical-sounding metal

Mixolydian Scale: Jam band music

Phrygian Scale: Very dark, exotic, middle-eastern/arabian sound, exotic-sounding metal
