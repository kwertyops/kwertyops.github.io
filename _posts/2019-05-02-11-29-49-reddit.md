wow thank you I've actually never gotten any feedback at all on South High Street and I really appreciate you saying that because I love it, and it's associated with such awesome memories. it's actually just recordings of an improvisational jam that some friends and I did one day many years ago. I kept the bits that seemed like they had the most potential. I wish we kept playing together but everyone went their separate ways. such is life.
