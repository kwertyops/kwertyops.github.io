If you don't mind a few more questions:

1. do you know what brain area was targeted in your case? 
2. what was the problem that you were having treated with TMS (depression, etc)?
3. how did TMS come up as a potential solution - was this at the recommendation of a doctor, or did you just find somewhere that does this treatment?
