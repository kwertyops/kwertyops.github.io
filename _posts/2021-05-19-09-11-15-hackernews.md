This tool is the kind of thing that I&#x27;d guess very few people have ever thought about needing or wanting... But if you&#x27;re one of the few who have, I think this project may be THE thing that you&#x27;re looking for.

The short version is this: it takes a leadsheet (melody + chord symbols) of the kind you&#x27;d typically find for a jazz tune, in MusicXML format, and it generates a chord-melody arrangement using a standardized set of chord voicings. The output includes fretboard diagrams, and the melody can be shown in tablature or in standard notation. There are a few options to fiddle with to get different results, depending on your needs.

This isn&#x27;t the kind of project I&#x27;d ever expect to be profitable, but it&#x27;s gotten to the point where it&#x27;s useful enough for me that I think it could be useful for other too.

It&#x27;s hard to get perspective on a project like this since it&#x27;s so personal, so I&#x27;d love any feedback. If this is something you might find useful, please let me know what you think!
