Haha I had low expectations, but I like this a lot. :)

The only thing that stands out to me that pulls me out a bit is that the vocal track has a bit too much space on it - I can't tell if it's just the reverb you have on it, or if it's maybe the space you recorded in. It feels just a little bit too distant. But that's a really subtle thing. Overall love this track!
