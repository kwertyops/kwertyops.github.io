I teach in the CS department at a University. My Intro to Programming for Non-Majors class has used p5js for the last 4 years, and the Intro for Majors is using a custom drawing library in Python built on top of pygame.

I would rather the non-majors learn the same language as the majors, and I would rather the majors have a platform that makes collaboration easier. Your editor seems like it ticks many of the boxes I'm looking for!

Feel free to PM if you want to talk more - I can send you my email.
