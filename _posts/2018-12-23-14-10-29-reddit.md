Aha, nice! Yes, in gypsy jazz in particular there's a bit of a thing about using altered dominants in a way that's not necessarily functional, but just to give some extra tension and flavor. When playing gypsy jazz a very common trick is playing a V7#5 sound to resolve to a I, just because it sounds cool and outside. It's similar to playing a ivm6 -> I resolution - basically same thing. Django did this a lot.

In his case I think Stochelo is using it more like an A7b9b5, so --

Try this - play that chord he plays (a A7b9b5, if you will) and resolve it directly to the standard gypsy jazz voicing for a D69:

5 x 5 3 4 x -> 5 5 4 4 5 5

Sounds hip, no? ;)
