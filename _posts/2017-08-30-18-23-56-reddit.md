The voicings that I'm using here come directly from guitar, and because I am a guitar player this note layout (rows in 4ths) is very intuitive to me. I already know all the shapes, I'm just playing them with two hands now instead of one.

I imagine it would be much harder to go from piano to the Push.. But if I could play piano, I probably wouldn't need to learn to play the Push. :p
