If the chord progression implies a very strong, specific, and complex harmonic movement, sometimes there's nothing to do but just play the changes. 

If there is a strong and stable implied key, something like Rhythm Changes for example, then just focusing on the implied key can work well.

Sometimes even if there's not one single implied key for an entire section, you might still be able to simplify and group chords together into subsections with similar tonality. You might end up with 2 or 3 different tonal chunks with a number of changes inside each.

Another thing you might try is re-harmonizing, or super-imposing your own chord changes that are similar to the ones you're playing over, but maybe that you're more familiar with. If there's a section of one chord.. going into some other chord... resolving to a tonic.. then it'll probably sound find to play it as if it were a ii V I (or whatever) even if it's not actually a ii V I.
