The fact that the Push colors the root note, and shows sharps and flats with light and dark pads, helps immensely. If all the pads looked the same, this would be much harder. But it's easy to keep track of where I am relative to the root notes, and sharps and flats are guideposts in between. I imagine it's similar to the way a piano player thinks.
