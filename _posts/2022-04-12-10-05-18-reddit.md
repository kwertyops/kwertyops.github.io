In general, try to forget about scales and focus on playing the changes. Visualizing arpeggios is the quickest way to playing the changes.

If you want to noodle around in a scale, then here are some good bang-for-your-buck your options:

* Major Scale (for parts of a tune in a major tonality)
* Harmonic Minor Scale (for parts of a tune in minor tonality)

But you should probably focus on playing something different over each chord. The best bang-for-your-buck arpeggios for gypsy jazz are probably something like:

* Major Chord
-> Major 6 Arpeggio (1, 3, 5, 6)
* Minor Chord
-> Minor 6 Arpeggio (1, b3, 5, 6)
* Dominant Chord
-> Dominant 9 Arpeggio (1, 2, 3, 5, b7) 
* Dominant Chord
-> Diminished 7 Arpeggio from the b9 (b9, 3, 5, b7 - relative to the root of the dominant chord)
